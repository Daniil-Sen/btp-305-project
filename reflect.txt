Hello professor, this milestone is late because I have a lot of other classes to work on plus my
obligations outside of school. However this milestone is still late and I accept that.

Comment 1:
Ther are many different ways of writing code to complete a task. In milestone 2 I wrote a fillItem
function that passed milestone 2 requirements. But when I attempted to use it in milestone 3, it
would not output correctly (specifically when filling out orders, in iteration 6 where where an order
is outputted twice, but my version only handled it once). I have noticed in previous workshops or courses
where a function in a previous part passed the tests, but didnt pass other parts. It was giving my some
trouble. In this project, keeping track of the variables and the changes from stl algorithms are more
difficult and I think thats why I had issues solving that problem.

Comment 2:
I have noticed that the attemptToMoveOrder() function in Workstation class returns a bool. But I do not 
know why it neccessary.
